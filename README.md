# Pair-Programming-Exercise


Pair yourself with a classmate. Send the link of your GitHub repository to your pair via Slack. Now each of you should perform the following set of actions:

Fork your classmate's repository.
Clone the repository, so that you have it locally and can make changes.
Create a new branch named classmate.
Create a new file with your name (ex. maya.txt) and finish the following sentence I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because.... When you are done, save the changes.
Add the changes to the git.
Commit and push the changes. Now, all the changes should be on your GitHub, inside the forked repository.
Create a pull request to make changes appear in the original repository.
Merge the branch your classmate created. Now everyone's repos should have the original file (about.txt) as well as the new one with your classmate's name.
